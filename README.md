# Orient(able)

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/filecoin-project/orient/tree/master.svg?style=svg&circle-token=e06461d4c5ca9731534a1e238c77e575d368798c)](https://circleci.com/gh/filecoin-project/orient/tree/master)

Orient began life as a proof-of-concept reference implementation intended as a lightweight way to explore and clarify
the (now somewhat outdated) [Orientable specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zjWHegvZwTgvU4fOAjUbIwMwQyfPzHoXJVTX8iR--2E/edit#heading=h.2jf8rxk263pw).

The underlying framework has been developed alongside the [Filecoin Übercalc](ubercalc/ubercalc.org). Eventually the repositories
for these two projects will be split. In the meantime, for ease of development and deployment, they are colocated
here.

For a brief introduction to Orient, see the [tutorial](tutorial.org).

## Installation

### sbcl

Code is in Common Lisp, developed and (to the extent it is) tested with SBCL.
```bash
> brew install sbcl
```

or
```bash
> apt-get install sbcl
```

### QuickLisp & ASDF

Install [QuickLisp](https://www.quicklisp.org):

- Download the file for installation. (https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp)
- Then run sbcl with that file loaded by this command.

```sh
sbcl --load path/of/quicklisp.lisp
```

After sbcl launched, type in the command below.

```lisp
(quicklisp-quickstart:install)
```

Now Quicklisp has been installed. To ensure Quicklisp is loaded every time you start Lisp, type in the command below.

```lisp
(ql:add-to-init-file)
```

### Optional for Emacs Users
*NOTE:* If you intend to develop on or with Orient (as opposed to just use CLI or web interfaces), then use of Emacs +
Slime is strongly recommended.

Type in the command which will create a file you can load in Emacs to configure the right load-path for loading
Quicklisp's installation of SLIME.

```lisp
(ql:quickload "quicklisp-slime-helper")
```

Then configure Emacs to use Slime. Here is a simple but helpful configuration to place in you `.emacs` file:

```lisp
(use-package slime
  :init
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c z") 'slime-repl)
  (load (expand-file-name "~/quicklisp/slime-helper.el"))
  (setq inferior-lisp-program "/usr/local/bin/sbcl")
  (add-to-list 'slime-contribs 'slime-repl))
```

Ensure the path to your sbcl installation is correct.

You may also need to first [install use-package](https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/installation/) by carefully
following the linked instructions. This is strongly recommended.

### Integrate the project with quicklisp

QuickLisp needs to find the project, so add a symlink:

```bash
> cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
> ln -s ~/<installdir>/orient/orient.asd orient.asd
```

### Test the Setup

When configured correctly, this should work and show no failures:

```bash
> sbcl
This is SBCL 1.4.14, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.

You should get similar output from the shell:

```bash
>  make test
```

To start a web server, from REPL:

```lisp
(orient.web:start-web)
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8888`.

To generate graphs, you will need [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/).

To generate and view graphs, `graphviz` must be installed locally, and `dot` must be in the path.


## CLI

There are severals ways to run the CLI.

### Development Mode

- Install [cl-launch](https://www.cliki.net/cl-launch), so `/usr/local/bin/cl`

For example, you may need to create a symlink:
```bash
> ln -s /<installdir>cl-launch.sh /usr/local/bin/cl
>  cl
cl-launch.sh 4.1.5

For help, invoke script with help argument:
        /usr/local/bin/cl -h
```

Now you can run the CLI and source changes will be immediately reflected, but startup is a bit slow.
```bash
> ./bin/orient ... <args>
```

### Executable Image

If you just want to *use* the CLI, first dump an image:

```bash
> make ubercalc
```

Now startup should be very fast:

```bash
> ./bin/ucalc ... <args>
```

### Docker

If you're having a hard time setting up a development environment, Docker might be easiest, but startup is a bit slow.

```docker
> make docker
> ./bin/dcalc ... <args>
```

### Tests from shell

```bash
> make test
```
